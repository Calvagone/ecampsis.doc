The app is built on the R-package campsis, which serves as a powerful frontend for running model-based simulations using mrgsolve or rxode2. 1.1 e-Campsis versions 1.1.1 e-Campsis free e-Campsis free included many functionalities to provide intuitive and user-friendly interface for setting up population PK/PD simulations. 1.1.2 e-Campsis free+ e-Campsis free has certain limitations regarding the simulation size for unregistered users. If you want to simulate up to 16 arms or scenarios, 100 subjects/arm and 250 observations/arm we invite you to become an authorized user of e-Campsis free+. Please send us the pre-filled email below and you will get an invitation to register as soon as possible: campsis@calvagone.com 1.1.3 e-Campsis pro At Calvagone we are currently working on an advanced version of e-Campsis including the following additional functionality: No limitation of number of subjects, observations, ODEs, arms or scenarios Save all settings of your simulation project within the Shiny environment Import external data into plots for visual comparison to simulations Extensive library, including models with categorical endpoints Sampling of covariates from external databases like e.g. NHANES Run trial replicates, taking into account parameter uncertainty Post-processing of simulation results, applying for example NCA or statistical tests Efficient generation of forest plots on derived simulation output (e.g. Cmax, AUC, effect@time) Semi-automatic parameter sensitivity analysis For further information, contact us at the following e-mail address: campsis@calvagone.com 1.2 Application interface The app consists of 4 main sections: Model: a powerful model editor to edit your Campsis model online. Try out one of the numerous models available from the library and adapt it to your needs. Trial design: an easy-to-use interface to quickly set-up the dosing regimen, observation times and covariates. Simulation: a single screen dedicated to the simulation configuration and visualisation of the results. Explore different scenarios of parameter settings quickly and interactively. Download: last but not least, download the model, parameters and the whole code of the simulation to reproduce what you see in the app on your computer using the open-source package campsis.
