# Download

In the download section you can see the full R-code to run the simulation on your local machine. There are checkboxes that allow to include/remove certain sections that may not be needed.

Of course, post-processing or forest plot code can only be included in the script if you have run that simulation before.

## Renv for total reproduceability (pro version only)

Simulations with e-Campsis depend on many R packages and it is quite likely that a script that runs today on your computer with the current versions of dependencies may not run without issues in a year or so when you update your R-installation the next time. To overcome this R-specific challenge you can include a `renv::use` block in your simulation script.

When you then execute the script on your computer a temporary renv-package library will be generated and all dependencies will be downloaded and installed with the exact same version as indicated. This will allow you to reproduce your simulations also 5 years from now without issues.

There are only two requirements for this to work:

1) renv must be installed in your R-environment first (read more about renv [here](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html).

2) you need a C++ compiler to run `mrgsolve`. For Windows you simply need to install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools44/rtools.html) first (currently version 4.4) . For mac and linux you need to install a fortran compiler (see [here](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/mrgsolve/wiki/mrgsolve-Installation#compilers-buid-tools) for instructions).
