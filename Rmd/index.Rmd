# About

[e-Campsis](https://ecampsis.shinyapps.io/free/) is a free web application developed by [Calvagone](https://www.calvagone.com/) that provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for setting up population PK/PD simulations.
The app is built on the R-package [campsis](https://calvagone.github.io/), which serves as a powerful frontend for running model-based simulations using *mrgsolve* or *rxode2*.

## e-Campsis versions

### e-Campsis free
*e-Campsis free* included many functionalities to provide intuitive and user-friendly interface for setting up population PK/PD simulations.

### e-Campsis free+
*e-Campsis free* has certain limitations regarding the simulation size for unregistered users.

If you want to simulate up to 16 arms or scenarios, 100 subjects/arm and 250 observations/arm we invite you to become an authorized user of *e-Campsis free+*.

Please send us the pre-filled email below and you will get an invitation to register as soon as possible: campsis@calvagone.com

### e-Campsis pro
At **Calvagone** we are currently working on an advanced version of e-Campsis including the following additional functionality:

* No limitation of number of subjects, observations, ODEs, arms or scenarios
* Save all settings of your simulation project within the Shiny environment
* Import external data into plots for visual comparison to simulations
* Extensive library, including models with categorical endpoints
* Sampling of covariates from external databases like e.g. NHANES
* Run trial replicates, taking into account parameter uncertainty
* Post-processing of simulation results, applying for example NCA or statistical tests
* Efficient generation of forest plots on derived simulation output (e.g. Cmax, AUC, effect@time)
* Semi-automatic parameter sensitivity analysis

For further information, contact us at the following e-mail address: campsis@calvagone.com

## Application interface

The app consists of 4 main sections:

* **Model**: a powerful model editor to edit your Campsis model online. Try out one of the numerous models available from the library and adapt it to your needs.
* **Trial design**: an easy-to-use interface to quickly set-up the dosing regimen, observation times and covariates.
* **Simulation**: a single screen dedicated to the simulation configuration and visualisation of the results. Explore different scenarios of parameter settings quickly and interactively.
* **Download**: last but not least, download the model, parameters and the whole code of the simulation to reproduce what you see in the app on your computer using the open-source package campsis.
