# About

[e-Campsis](https://webapp.e-campsis.com/) is a free web application developed by [Calvagone](https://www.calvagone.com/) that provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for setting up population PK/PD simulations. The app is built on the R-package [campsis](https://calvagone.github.io/), which serves as a powerful frontend for running model-based simulations using *mrgsolve* or *rxode2*.

## e-Campsis versions

### e-Campsis free

*e-Campsis free* is, as the name suggests, freely accessible to everyone without registration at <https://webapp.e-campsis.com/>.

It comes with certain limitations regarding the size of the simulation and misses some functionality of the pro-version.

### e-Campsis pro

The professional version of e-Campsis is available as a yearly subscription and includes the following additional functionality:

-   Save/load e-Campsis projects
-   NONMEM&reg;, Monolix&reg; and rxode2 code import
-   Number of arms, scenarios, subjects, observations only limited by memory
-   Advanced customization of plots
-   NCA & summary statistics
-   Sensitivity analysis
-   Forest plots
-   Overlay external data on plots
-   Bootstrap covariates from external file or NHANES
-   Replicate simulation with parameter uncertainty
-   Personalized support via email

## Application interface

The app consists of 8 main sections:

-   **Model**: a powerful model editor to edit your Campsis model online. Try out one of the numerous models available from the library and adapt it to your needs.
-   **Trial design**: an easy-to-use interface to quickly set-up the dosing regimen, observation times and covariates.
-   **Simulation**: a single screen dedicated to the simulation configuration and visualization of the results. Explore different scenarios of parameter settings quickly and interactively. Overlay external data and produce beautiful ggplot2-based plots.
-   **Post-processing**: here you can define summary variables such as non-compartmental PK parameters that you want to derive from your simulation results and show them in a table.
-   **Sensitivity analysis**: explore the effects of changing your model parameters on any outcome parameter (NCA metric) you have defined in the post-processing phase.
-   **Forest plots**: easily define and generate nice-looking forest plots and explore the impact of covariates on any outcome parameter.
-   **Settings**: define the time units of the user interface. More settings will come soon.
-   **Download**: last but not least, download the model, parameters and the whole code of the simulation to reproduce what you see in the app on your computer using the open-source Campsis suite.
