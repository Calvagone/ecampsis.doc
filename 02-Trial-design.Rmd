# Trial design

## Trial design
Several study arms can be configured.

For each arm tab, the following information can be entered:

* Number of subjects
* Arm label
* Administration type
* Dose amount
* Compartment (in which compartment the dose should be assigned)
* Dosing interval
* Add. doses (number of additional doses)
* Observations (observation time), to be written in R format, e.g. *seq(0,24,by=1)* or *c(seq(0, 5), seq(0, 5)+168, seq(0,5)+336, seq(0,504,6))*. Enable the "as-time-after-dose" box, if you want to replicate the observation schedule after each dose.
* Covariates; e.g. *BW=70*, *DOSE=1|BW=70*, *WT=NormalDistribution(mean=70, sd=10)*
* Dose adaptation formula (useful if the dose has to be adapted to the body weight); e.g. _DOSE*BW_

## Summary

A summary of your trial design in shown in this box, where you can quickly visualise the characteristics of your arms. 

## Custom dataset

The simulation dataset (arms) can be further edited by clicking "Edit dataset" button.
