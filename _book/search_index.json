The app is built on the R-package campsis, which serves as a powerful frontend for running model-based simulations using mrgsolve or rxode2. 1.1 e-Campsis versions 1.1.1 e-Campsis free e-Campsis free is, as the name suggests freely accessible to everyone without registration at https://ecampsis.shinyapps.io/free/. It comes with certain limitations regarding the size of the simulation and misses some functionality of pro-version. 1.1.2 e-Campsis free+ If you want to simulate up to 16 arms or scenarios, 100 subjects/arm and 250 observations/arm we invite you to become an authorized user of e-Campsis free+. Please send us the pre-filled email below and you will get an invitation to register as soon as possible: campsis@calvagone.com 1.1.3 e-Campsis pro The professional version of e-Campsis is available as a yearly subscription and includes the following additional functionality: Save/load e-campsis projects NONMEM code import Number of arms, scenarios, subjects, observations only limited by memory Advanced customization of plots NCA &amp; summary statistics Sensitivity analysis* Forest plots* Upload of external data for plotting* Bootstrap covariates from external file or NHANES* Replicate simulation with parameter uncertainty* Import rxode2 and mrgsolve simulation code* Personalized support via email For further information, contact us at the following e-mail address: campsis@calvagone.com 1.2 Application interface The app consists of 4 main sections: Model: a powerful model editor to edit your Campsis model online. Try out one of the numerous models available from the library and adapt it to your needs. Trial design: an easy-to-use interface to quickly set-up the dosing regimen, observation times and covariates. Simulation: a single screen dedicated to the simulation configuration and visualisation of the results. Explore different scenarios of parameter settings quickly and interactively. Post-processing: here you can define summary variables such as non-compartmental PK parameters that you want to derive from your simulation results and show them in a table. Download: last but not least, download the model, parameters and the whole code of the simulation to reproduce what you see in the app on your computer using the open-source package campsis. "]]
