The app is built on the R-package campsis, which serves as a powerful frontend for running model-based simulations using mrgsolve or rxode2. 1.1 e-Campsis versions 1.1.1 e-Campsis free e-Campsis free included many functionalities to provide intuitive and user-friendly interface for setting up population PK/PD simulations. 1.1.2 e-Campsis free+ e-Campsis free has certain limitations regarding the simulation size for unregistered users. If you want to simulate up to 16 arms or scenarios, 100 subjects/arm and 250 observations/arm we invite you to become an authorized user of e-Campsis free+. Please send us the pre-filled email below and you will get an invitation to register as soon as possible: campsis@calvagone.com 1.1.3 e-Campsis pro At Calvagone we are currently working on an advanced version of e-Campsis including the following additional functionality: No limitation of number of subjects, observations, ODEs, arms or scenarios Save all settings of your simulation project within the Shiny environment Import external data into plots for visual comparison to simulations Extensive library, including models with categorical endpoints Sampling of covariates from external databases like e.g. NHANES Run trial replicates, taking into account parameter uncertainty Post-processing of simulation results, applying for example NCA or statistical tests Efficient generation of forest plots on derived simulation output (e.g. Cmax, AUC, effect@time) Semi-automatic parameter sensitivity analysis For further information, contact us at the following e-mail address: campsis@calvagone.com 1.2 Application interface The app consists of 4 main sections: Model: a powerful model editor to edit your Campsis model online. Try out one of the numerous models available from the library and adapt it to your needs. Trial design: an easy-to-use interface to quickly set-up the dosing regimen, observation times and covariates. Simulation: a single screen dedicated to the simulation configuration and visualisation of the results. Explore different scenarios of parameter settings quickly and interactively. Download: last but not least, download the model, parameters and the whole code of the simulation to reproduce what you see in the app on your computer using the open-source package campsis.

A different PK model can be selected from a large library (“Select PK model”), or a PD model can be connected (“Connect PD model”) to the PK model. In “Select category”, NONMEM models or TMDD models can be also loaded. 2.2 Campsis model import An existing Campsis model can be uploaded from this box (including files model.campsis, omega.csv, theta.csv and sigma.csv). 2.3 NONMEM model import (pro-version) In the pro version, an existing NONMEM model can be uploaded from this box (including files .mod and .ext) and will be automatically translated to Campsis code. The NONMEM import functionality will be installed, the process can take several minutes. A notification will popup when done. 2.4 Model code The model code is shown in the editor window where it can be easily modified. Please note that the code is case sensitive (e.g. log, exp, sqrt should be used). The power function is pow(x,d), x to the power of d. Clicking on the “Download” button, Campsis model code will be downloaded as a ZIP folder, including model.campsis, omega.csv, theta.csv and sigma.csv. 2.5 Parameters The list of parameters for THETA, OMEGA and SIGMA is given in this box. Their values and labels can be changed. Comments can be added. The type for OMEGA and SIGMA can be changed: sd, var, covar, cv, cv%, cor, for standard deviation, variance, covariance, coefficient of variation, coefficient of variation (as %) or correlation, respectively. Correlations between omegas can be added by right-clicking on a cell in the OMEGA table. For example, enter “KA, VC” as name, 1 and 2 in index and index2, and add the correlation value. Clicking on “Get parameter names from code”, the code will be scanned for the #THETA, #OMEGA and #SIGMA and the names will be extracted and added to the table. Tables can be edited.

For each arm tab, the following information can be entered: Number of subjects Arm label Administration type (bolus or infusion) If infusion is selected, you can choose whether the infusion is in the Model or in the Dataset; if the latter, the infusion duration can be entered Dose amount Compartment (in which compartment the dose should be assigned) Dosing interval Add. doses (number of additional doses) Observations (observation time), to be written in R format, e.g. seq(0,24,by=1) or c(seq(0, 5), seq(0, 5)+168, seq(0,5)+336, seq(0,504,6)). Enable the “as-time-after-dose” box, if you want to replicate the observation schedule after each dose. Covariates; e.g. BW=70, DOSE=1|BW=70, WT=NormalDistribution(mean=70, sd=10) Dose adaptation formula (useful if the dose has to be adapted to the body weight); e.g. DOSE*BW. 3.2 Summary A summary of your trial design in shown in this box, where you can quickly visualise the characteristics of your arms. 3.3 Custom dataset The simulation dataset (arms) can be further edited by clicking “Edit dataset” button.

For each scenario, parameter values can be changed. 4.2 Simulation settings IIV/RUV: Should the inter-individual and residual variability be taken into account in the simulations? Check IIV or RUV boxes accordingly. Seed: a seed number can be used. Select output(s): select one or several outputs you would like to look at. Select engine: choose one of the two simulation packages rxode2 or mrgsolve.
